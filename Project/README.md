# Extracted Project (from PDF)
This is a best-effort extraction of the *Metrorail_management_System* project from the provided PDF report.

- Source: `Metrorail_Management_System-Code-Report[Updated].pdf`
- Some files may be partially extracted due to PDF text layout/formatting.
- Directory structure and filenames match what was found in the report.
- You may need to manually fill in any sections marked as **Partial content**.

## Quick start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Notes
- Database credentials are read from `app.py` as found in the report.
- Templates are under `views/`.
- If you need me to refine/complete any specific file, just say the filename and I'll extract that section more precisely.
